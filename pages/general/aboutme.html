<p>Proud to be a founding member of Oracle New Zealand, I've spent over 25 years solving knotty database problems for large enterprise and public sector organizations, and businesses trying to pull meaningful information from a sea of data. I consider myself a pragmatic DBA, drawing on my technical expertise and knowledge of how the real business world works to provide consulting services that are truly appreciated by customers. I'm an Oracle Certified Professional specializing in Oracle RDBMS, RAC, GoldenGate (replication & migration). I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from Massey University and enjoy fishing from a kayak in my spare time. I'm lucky to say I haven't encountered any really big sharks yet.</p>
