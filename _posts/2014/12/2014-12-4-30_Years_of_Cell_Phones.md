![30 Years of Cell Phones](/images/blogging/30cellphones.jpg)

I got my first cell phone in the early 90’s. I seem to change my phone every 2 or 3 years which is a good length of time for a piece of technology for someone in the tech industry, but even so, that’s about 9 or 10 phones over that period. I’ve never owned an iPhone and I’ve been using Android based phones for the last 2 or 3 updates. I’m not sure where the form-factor will go after the current smart phone style. Seems they have been increasing in size over the last few generations. I heard that the good old flip phones might be making a come back!
