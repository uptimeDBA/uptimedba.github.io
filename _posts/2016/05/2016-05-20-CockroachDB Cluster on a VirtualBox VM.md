Sometimes if you want to evaluate some new software or quickly try something, you have to spend a while setting things up or even learning some other piece of software to get to where you want to be. This guide is aimed at getting a minimal default CockroachDB database up and running on a local VirtualBox machine as quickly as possible.

This post is a link to the guide, which is hosted on github and can be found [here](//uptimedba.github.io/cockroach-vb-single/cockroach-vb-single/home.html).
