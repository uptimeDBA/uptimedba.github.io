As a technical specialist, I know a lot about very little. 

Sometimes when you’re asked to solve a problem for a customer, the best solution may be outside your area of expertise. The trick is to recognize this, and if you’re customer focused, direct them to resources capable of delivering the correct solution. Don’t try and fit your solution to their problem if it doesn’t work. They won’t be satisfied by the result and you’ll look like you don’t know what you’re doing. 

That’s never a good look.
